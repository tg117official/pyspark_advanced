Good Practices :
- Have EMR and Redshift in same region and in same VPC


On EMR :
- Update EMR Service Role to have redshiftAccess





On Redshift :

- Enable Accessibility
- Open Ports in Security Group

- Queries for IAM Access to Redshift
    ALTER TABLE public.employee OWNER TO root_user;

    CREATE USER iam_user WITH PASSWORD DISABLE;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE dev TO iam_user;
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO iam_user;

    GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO iam_user;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO iam_user;

    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON TABLES TO iam_user;
